How to set up a local copy in Windows Server 2008 w/SQL Server 2008:

1. Copy all files from this folder into some folder on the web server.
2. Create a database and login in SQL for 10c.co
3. Set up the new site in IIS. You need ASP.NET 4.0 (double check the app pool for 4.0).
4. Browse to 127.0.0.1 (or whatever) and it'll walk you through setting up the site.
5. You can access the admin backend with (domain)/umbraco/.

Contact sir@cmpwn.com if you've set something up and I'll point the 10c.co domain at it.
